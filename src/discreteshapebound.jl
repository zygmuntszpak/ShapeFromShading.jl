DiscreteShapeBound(iterations::Int = 2000, smoothness::Int = 1000, albedo::Real = Inf, illumination_direction::Vector{T} where T <: Real = [Inf, Inf, Inf])
```
Same as [`DiscreteShape`](@ref)
except it has its initial conditions bound by the image as per bellow where
``E`` is the brightness of the image:
```math
\begin{gathered}
Z_{i,j}=\begin{cases}-100E_{i,j} &\text{if } E_{i,j}>0.75\\0 &\text{otherwise}\\
\end{cases}\\\\p,q=\nabla E
\end{gathered}
```
# Example
Compute the heightmap for a synthetic image generated by `generate_surface`.
```julia
using Images, Makie, ShapeFromShading

#generate synthetic image
img = generate_surface(SynthSphere(50), 1.0, [0.2,0,0.9])

#calculate the heightmap (using 500 iterations)
discreteShapeBound = DiscreteShapeBound(iterations = 500, 1.0, [0.2,0,0.9])
Z,p,q = discreteShapeBound(img)

#normalize to maximum of 1 (not necessary but makes displaying easier)
Z = Z./maximum(Z)

#display using Makie (Note: Makie can often take several minutes first time)
r = 0.0:0.1:2
surface(r, r, Z)
```
